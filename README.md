## Description

My portfolio showcases my projects and skills as a web developer. It features a clean and modern design, with sections for my work, about me, and contact information. The site is fully responsive.

## Project Overview

This portfolio website is designed to highlight my work and abilities as a front-end developer. Key features include:

* Project Gallery: A showcase of my projects with descriptions and links to both the live sites and GitHub repositories.
* Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
* Interactive Elements: Smooth animations and transitions using Tailwind and JavaScript.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Patrick-Dolan/portfolio.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd portfolio
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The site should then be available at `http://localhost:5173/`. If that path doesn't work you're terminal should show you the correct path. 

## Usage

Navigate through the portfolio to view my projects, read about my background, and get in touch via the contact form. Each project in the gallery includes a brief description and a link to the live demo and GitHub repository.
